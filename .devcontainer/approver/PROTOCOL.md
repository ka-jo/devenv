# Approver Protocol

The contract between the three parties in the egress-approval system:

- **Proxy helper** — Squid's `external_acl` backend (`firewall/approve_helper.sh`),
  later a MITM proxy. Submits egress requests and blocks for a verdict. Runs on the
  `external` Docker network; reaches the approver by service name. **The only creator
  of requests, by design — and the only one there will ever be.**
- **Approver** — this service (`approver/server.ts`). Holds in-flight requests in
  process memory and brokers verdicts.
- **Extension** — the host-side VS Code extension (Phase 2). Observes pending
  requests and issues human verdicts. Reaches the approver over the host loopback
  publish (`127.0.0.1:3129`).

This document is the pinned contract; the approver refactor and the extension build
against it. It supersedes the Phase 1 surface (`POST /pending`, `GET /pending`,
`POST /decision`), which is collapsed into the single resource below.

---

## The resource

There is **one** resource: an **egress request awaiting a verdict**. Everything the
old surface called "pending" or "decision" is a *state* or a *state transition* on
this resource, not a resource of its own.

```ts
/** Lifecycle states. `pending` is the only non-terminal state; the rest are terminal and immutable. */
type RequestStatus = "pending" | "allowed" | "denied" | "expired";

/**
 * The one request representation — byte-identical across the REST JSON body, SSE
 * `snapshot` elements, and SSE `added` frames, so every consumer uses one parser.
 */
interface EgressRequest {
  /** UUID. The only correlation key. Never derived from request content (e.g. host). */
  id: string;
  /** Current lifecycle state. Always `"pending"` in stream `snapshot`/`added` frames. */
  status: RequestStatus;
  /** Opaque, proxy-supplied, render-only. The evolving part of the contract (see below). */
  metadata: RequestMetadata;
  /** Epoch ms the request entered `pending`. */
  createdAt: number;
  /** Epoch ms the request reached a terminal state. Present iff `status !== "pending"`. */
  decidedAt?: number;
}
```

### Envelope vs. metadata — the forward-compat seam

The **envelope** (`id`, `status`, `createdAt`, `decidedAt`) is stable: both halves
pin to it. The **metadata** is the part allowed to evolve. Today Squid's
`external_acl` only yields host-shaped data:

```ts
/** Squid era. Under MITM this grows (full URL, headers, SNI, body excerpt, …) — the envelope above does not move. */
interface RequestMetadata {
  /** Trimmed, lowercased target hostname. */
  host: string;
  /** Uppercased HTTP method, or `""` when the helper omitted it. */
  method: string;
  /** Full request URL when available (plain HTTP); `""` for HTTPS CONNECT tunnels where Squid sees only host:port. */
  url: string;
  /**
   * The Claude session this egress is attributed to, or `""` when untagged
   * (anonymous). The proxy adapter decodes it: the launcher embeds a per-session
   * token as the Basic-auth username in the egress proxy URL, so it arrives in the
   * `Proxy-Authorization` header; `firewall/approve_helper.sh` decodes it and emits
   * it here. Render-only like all metadata (see below). Attribution only — a process
   * can forge or drop the token, so it is never a trust boundary.
   */
  sessionId: string;
}
```

The approver **never reasons about `metadata` semantically** — not as a key, not as a
required field beyond minimal validation. "Approve all for host" and similar are
application-layer concerns owned entirely by the extension; they never touch this
service. `sessionId` is no exception: **per-session policy — e.g. "grant host X to
session Y for 30 minutes" — lives in the extension**, which reads `sessionId` off the
stream and auto-issues `PATCH` verdicts for matching requests. The approver only
carries the field. When the proxy is swapped for MITM, only `RequestMetadata` changes
(the adapter decodes `sessionId` its own way); the stream, the verdict path, and
correlation are untouched.

---

## Trust positioning (why the gating is split)

Recap of the network model (`docker-compose.yml`) that the auth rules below follow:

- The **proxy helper** creates requests from the `external` network. The sandboxed
  app container has **no route** to the approver at all (it is on `proxy_net` only).
- The **extension** reaches the approver solely via the host loopback publish.

Therefore:

| Operation | Caller | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| Create a request | proxy helper | **none** — gated by network segmentation; the helper can't hold the host token and doesn't need to |
| Read requests (list / stream / fetch) | extension | **token** |
| Issue a verdict | extension | **token** |

The token is the per-start secret minted by the approver and written to its tmpfs
(`/run/approver/token`); the extension retrieves it out-of-band
(`docker compose exec approver cat /run/approver/token`, re-fetched per session — it
rotates) and sends it in the **`x-approver-token`** header. It is defense-in-depth on
the one unavoidable surface (the published loopback port), not the primary control.

---

## REST surface

One collection (`/requests`) plus an ops endpoint. All bodies are JSON unless noted.

### `POST /requests` — create and await verdict

The proxy helper's sole call. **Always blocks** until the request reaches a terminal
state, then returns its terminal representation. (No `?wait` modifier: there is
exactly one consumer and it always wants to block. A non-blocking variant is YAGNI.)

- **Auth:** none.
- **Request body:** `RequestMetadata`.
- **Response `200 OK`:** the terminal `EgressRequest` (`status` ∈
  `allowed | denied | expired`, `decidedAt` set).
- **Response `400`:** malformed body.

Blocking is the idiomatic shape for a Squid `external_acl` helper — the protocol
expects the helper to block on stdin→stdout, and `curl`-then-parse-one-JSON-blob is
trivial in bash (an SSE stream would not be). Fail-closed: if the caller's socket
aborts (the helper's `--max-time`) before a verdict lands, the request transitions to
`expired` and a `resolved` frame is emitted (see SSE below); the helper, having given
up, denies.

`200` rather than `201`: the returned representation is the *resolved* resource, not a
freshly-created one, and the helper never refetches via `Location`. Creation is
incidental to "submit and await verdict."

### `GET /requests` — list (snapshot) or stream

Content-negotiated on `Accept`. Same resource collection, two representations.

- **Auth:** token.
- **`Accept: application/json`** (default): a one-shot snapshot.
  - Optional filter `?status=pending` (any `RequestStatus` accepted).
  - **`200 OK`:** `{ "requests": EgressRequest[] }`.
- **`Accept: text/event-stream`:** a live stream (see [SSE](#sse-stream)).
  - **`200 OK`** with `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, held open.

### `GET /requests/{id}` — fetch one

Rounds out the resource; useful for the extension to refetch or for debugging. Not
required by current consumers.

- **Auth:** token.
- **`200 OK`:** the `EgressRequest`.
- **`404`:** unknown `id` (never created, or already evicted after resolution).

### `PATCH /requests/{id}` — issue a verdict

A human verdict, modeled as a state transition on the request — **not** a separate
"decision" resource.

- **Auth:** token.
- **Request body:** `{ "status": "allowed" | "denied" }`.
  - Only `allowed` / `denied` are accepted. `expired` is system-only (the approver
    sets it on timeout); a client may not.
- **`200 OK`:** the terminal `EgressRequest`. This unblocks the helper's `POST` and
  emits a `resolved` frame, both from one settle.
- **`400`:** body missing or `status` not one of `allowed | denied`.
- **`401`:** missing/invalid token.
- **`404`:** unknown `id`.
- **`409 Conflict`:** the request is already terminal (verdicts are immutable).

### `GET /health` — liveness

- **Auth:** none. **`200 OK`**, body `OK`. Ops endpoint (the compose healthcheck);
  not a resource.

### Status transitions

```
            PATCH {status:"allowed"}        ┌──────────┐
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────▶│ allowed  │ (terminal)
   │                                         └──────────┘
┌──┴──────┐  PATCH {status:"denied"}         ┌──────────┐
│ pending ├────────────────────────────────▶ │ denied   │ (terminal)
└──┬──────┘                                   └──────────┘
   │        helper socket abort / timeout     ┌──────────┐
   └────────────────────────────────────────▶│ expired  │ (terminal, system-only)
                                              └──────────┘
```

Terminal states are immutable; any transition out of them is `409`.

## SSE stream {#sse-stream}

Opened via `GET /requests` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Standard SSE framing:

```
event: <type>
data: <json>

```

(blank line terminates a frame). We do **not** use `id:` / `Last-Event-ID` — reconnect
is "redial and re-snapshot," so per-event ids buy nothing.

### Frames

**`snapshot`** — sent once, immediately on connect; catches up a fresh or reconnected
client. Carries the full current pending set.

```
event: snapshot
data: {"requests":[{"id":"…","status":"pending","metadata":{"host":"api.foo.com","method":"GET","url":"http://api.foo.com/x"},"createdAt":1718000000000}]}
```

**`added`** — one request entered `pending`. Payload is an `EgressRequest` (same shape
as a snapshot element).

```
event: added
data: {"id":"…","status":"pending","metadata":{…},"createdAt":1718000000000}
```

**`resolved`** — a request left `pending`. **Lean delta**, not the full object: the
client already has `metadata` keyed by `id`, and resending it (potentially large under
MITM) is waste. One frame type covers human verdict and expiry — the consumer just
reads `status`.

```
event: resolved
data: {"id":"…","status":"denied","decidedAt":1718000000500}
```

```ts
/** Payload of a `resolved` frame. */
interface ResolvedFrame {
  id: string;
  /** Terminal status: `allowed`/`denied` (from PATCH) or `expired` (system timeout). */
  status: "allowed" | "denied" | "expired";
  decidedAt: number;
}
```

**keepalive** — an SSE comment line every ~20s (`:` prefix → ignored by every parser).
Cheap insurance against idle-drop; lets the client detect a dead server fast.

```
: keepalive

```

### Correctness requirements

- **Snapshot/subscribe atomicity.** The server must capture the snapshot *and*
  register the subscriber in the **same synchronous tick** (no `await` between). Bun
  is single-threaded, so this is free — and necessary, or an `added`/`resolved` can
  slip into the gap and be lost or duplicated.
- **Broadcast.** `added`/`resolved` fan out to **all** connected subscribers (multiple
  windows/reloads). A `Set` of stream controllers; remove a controller on its
  client's disconnect.
- **Tolerate unknown ids.** A client may receive a `resolved` for an `id` it never saw
  (resolved before it connected). Ignore it; not an error.

### Verdict fan-out

Both consumers learn a verdict from the **same** internal settle:

- **Helper** — its blocked `POST /requests` resolves and returns the terminal JSON.
- **Extension** — a `resolved` frame on its stream.

`PATCH /requests/{id}` (human) and the timeout path (system → `expired`) both flow
through that one settle, so neither consumer special-cases the source.

---

## Concurrency

Parallel pending requests come from Squid's helper **process pool**, not from
concurrency within one helper. `firewall/squid.conf`:

```
external_acl_type approver … children-startup=1 children-max=8 …
```

`children-max=8` ⇒ up to 8 independent helper processes, each one blocking `curl` →
one blocking `POST /requests` → one entry + waiter in the approver. The approver
already handles concurrent creates (each mints its own `id` + waiter; nothing shared).

- **Ceiling = `children-max` (8).** A 9th simultaneously-pending *novel* domain queues
  until one frees (a verdict, or a 120s expiry). Allowlisted traffic is fast-pathed
  and never consumes a child, so the pool is spent only on genuinely-new domains —
  human-speed, so 8 is generally plenty. Bump it if queuing appears.
- **`concurrency=N` is not the answer here.** It multiplexes N in-flight requests
  through *one* helper via channel ids, but a bash+`curl` helper can't multiplex
  (each `curl` blocks the process); it would require an async rewrite for no gain. The
  multi-process model fits one-blocking-`curl`-per-child exactly. Keep it.

---

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- **Dedupe by host / "approve all for host"** — application-layer (extension) concern;
  never in the approver. The proxy will not stay host-based (MITM), so host semantics
  must not be baked into the broker.
- **Persistent history / remembered verdicts** — no DB. The live waiter map cannot be
  serialized (waiters are promise resolvers bound to open sockets), and the queryable
  state is human-scale. If durable audit/history is ever wanted, reach for
  *file-backed* SQLite (`bun:sqlite`); in-memory SQLite is the cost of a DB with none
  of its durability and is never the right call here.
- **Frame/representation versioning** — YAGNI for two halves of one repo. A top-level
  `v` is cheap to add if the envelope ever breaks.
